Halloumi may be on the tip of your tongue when listing off your favorite cheeses, but it absolutely should be! Allow us to expand your fromage horizons.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-halloumi-cheese-from><strong>Where is halloumi cheese from?</strong></h2><p>Halloumi is a Mediterranean cheese made principally in Cyprus from sheep or goat milk (or sometimes even a mixture of the two). It’s made very similarly to another Mediterranean staple, <a href=#>feta cheese</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-halloumi-cheese-taste-like><strong>What does halloumi cheese taste like?</strong></h2><p>Halloumi is often described as mellow, but don’t think for a minute that this cheese is boring. It is vaguely feta-like, notably tangy, and not too strong. This cheese is great for those with delicate palettes, it has just enough flavor without getting into stinky cheese territory. A perfect “middle of the road” cheese if ever there was one! The real appeal of halloumi, though, is its texture. When you bite into it, it often produces a squeaking sound as it rubs against your teeth (much like <a href=#>fresh cheese curds</a>).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-to-eat-halloumi-cheese><strong>How to eat halloumi cheese?</strong></h2><p>Halloumi can be sliced (for a simple snack or charcuterie boards), chopped up (for a salad), or melted into a sandwich. But halloumi is unlike most other cheeses in that it can be grilled—not in a grilled cheese sandwich but on its own, directly on the grill grates. It holds its shape and gets a crispy crust on the outside while becoming just a bit gooey on the inside. It’s also used in saganaki, a Greek dish of fried halloumi.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-can-you-eat-halloumi-cheese-raw><strong>Can you eat halloumi cheese raw?</strong></h2><p>Halloumi can be eaten raw or cooked. Its high melting point makes it an excellent choice for grilling or frying, but don’t stop that from allowing yourself to simply eat it as is. There’s no bad way to eat it, so long as you don’t miss your mouth!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmn5qknKTCrrWMnJ%2BenaOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
