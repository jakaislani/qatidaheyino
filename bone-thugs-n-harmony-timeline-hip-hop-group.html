The beef was so long-running, in fact, that when the two groups met on Verzuz in 2021, a physical fight actually broke out. Insults were exchanged and eventually, so were apologies â€” but, what gives?&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to DJ Paul's interview with <a href=#>Blurred Culture</a>, it was all rooted in a misunderstanding.

We were like, 'Damn these dudes done stole our style! That's why we got mad about it."</p><p>On the other side, Krayzie Bone talked to <a href=#>Hip Hop DX</a> about the so-called feud, saying that they didn't know anything about it until one of their fans tipped them off that there was another group that had claimed that Bone Thugs had ripped off their style. "I really didn't understand what the beef was until I talked to somebody on the phone one day," he said. "It was a conference call, ... And they was like, 'We just want ya'll to know it ain't no beef, it ain't no nothing.' All that stuff was stupid."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kXFqbXFmZK%2BwusRmq6Gtl6h6r3nHmqmmp56uerW1zJ6joqaVYrWqvIyhpqlll6e8tryO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
