We’re celebrating <a href=#>Uncle Sam(wich) week</a> this week, so we asked the team of Kitcheneers for their favorite sandwich ingredients and sides.Today, Nicole Enayati shares her go-to drizzle that will elevate everything from bologna to lox.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Nicole’s Pick: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Brightland Pizza Oil</strong></a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MK-PICKS_SANDWICH-FAVS_NICOLE-INSET-1170x658.jpg><p>Brightland has been making kickass olive oils for years now. They have these gorgeous, iconic bottles that just scream, “PUT ME IN YOUR SHOPPING BASKET.” And most of the time, I do. Not gonna lie, my at-home fancy olive oil budget is nuts. But, it now seems like the fine people at Brightland are venturing into the squeeze bottle olive oil game, and I am not complaining!&nbsp;</p><p>This olive oil is made with rich, California olive oil, tons of herbs, garlic, and jalapeno for a kick. The secret to making this really taste like pizza is the green bell pepper extract; it creates this quintessential local pizza spot flavor that is so unique. And I just love how sharp and heavy the jalapeno flavor is! Now, I know, this product is branded as a pizza oil—as in, oil to put on pizza. But, holy crap, this luscious liquid is killer on grilled meats, pasta salads, and anything 4th of July celebration-related. They have truly made a versatile product.&nbsp;</p><p>And it really makes any sandwich a billion times better. Anything from an Italian sub, a grilled veggies on focaccia situation, <a href=#>bagel with lox</a>, a classic <a href=#>white bread</a> bologna sandwich with chips shoved in it, hell, even a cheeky breakfast avocado toast. It totally elevates it. Just squeeze some on top of your sandwich fixings, and you’re good! I use it to dress the greens on top of my sandwich. Something like a simple shredded cabbage lovingly tossed with some of this pizza oil and red wine vinegar is *chef’s kiss* on a chicken sandwich hot off the grill. Damn, I can taste it already. This screams fireworks in your mouth, and is the perfect gourmet addition to any 4th of July tablescape.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKaZmLytsYyepZqxkam2brLAr6aroaSaerStzZ2uopuYYrCwusOipJ6mpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
