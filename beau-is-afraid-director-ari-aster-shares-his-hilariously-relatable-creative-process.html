From White Noise to Bodies Bodies Bodies to Tusk to The Green Knight to their crown jewel of Everything Everywhere All at Once, it’s near impossible to suggest that any film studio embraces the creative spirit quite like A24 does.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>And few have taken advantage of such a mandate quite like <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ari Aster</a></strong> has; with the likes of Hereditary and Midsommar having established themselves as modern classics under Aster’s eldritch masterminding, the filmmaker’s name can get any horror aficionado excited these days.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>His latest project, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Beau Is Afraid</strong></a>, is no exception, and that’s even without considering the starring presence of Joaquin Phoenix, its pitch as a psychedelic nightmare epic, or accusations that this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">polarizing bizarro-fest is a “career killer,”</a> which obviously just makes the idea of seeing this film all the more attractive.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>But with Aster’s filmography having built up to a feature that came out of something much further than left field, now seems appropriate to ask the question of how the filmmaker’s brain manages to spawn such ideas in the first place, which one Redditor was all too happy to do during a Reddit AMA with Aster himself.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>And his answer was the perfect blend of “of course,” “…oh,” and “preach it, brother.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Ari_Aster</a> from discussion <a href=#>Hi, I’m Ari Aster, writer/director of Beau Is Afraid.

But any artist will also tell you that once the piece reaches its final form, as Beau Is Afraid has now done, the collateral concussions are worth it.</p><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=52 data-injectable=false>Beau Is Afraid will release to theaters on April 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZ6ZpWK2tHnAn6maoZRisaq%2BxJyrqKpdlr%2BqecCsq56qXai1or7ErGShoaNitaq4wKugqK2jocZuvsSlmK2ZkqGybq%2FRnpitoaaaerG%2BzpycrKtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
