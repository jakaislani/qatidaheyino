The loss of country singer Porter Wagoner, who helped kick start her career, was particularly hard. She even penned 1973's "<a href=#>I Will Always Love You</a>" — which Whitney Houston re-recorded for 1992's The Bodyguard — <a href=#>about their professional split</a>. Parton and Wagoner had made up by the time he passed from lung cancer in 2007, and she believes (via <a href=#>The Guardian</a>) that "part of him will always live through me and my music." Even more heartbreaking, Parton sang to Wagoner on his deathbed, saying, "It felt good that I had the opportunity to say goodbye properly."</p><p>In 2017,&nbsp;The Detroit News reported that her longtime manager Don Warden had died of unknown causes. After working together for almost 50 years, Parton called him "Mr. Everything." In a post on her <a href=#>website</a>,&nbsp;she described him "like a father, a brother, a partner, and one of my best friends."&nbsp;</p><p>The loss of country singer <a href=#>Kenny Rogers, who died in 2020</a> of natural causes, also "shocked" her, she told the <a href=#>TODAY</a>. The two duetted on hits like "Islands in the Stream," and after his death, Parton said on <a href=#>Facebook</a> that her "heart's broken, and a big ol' chunk of it has gone with him today."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xkbH13e8Ooo6WxXaWus8DOp2ShmaNiuaawjJpkraqRnLakecuinZ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
