These fluffy clouds of beautifully airy, lightly sweet bread go well with anything from peanut butter to pulled pork to a second Hawaiian roll stuffed in your mouth at the same time. Point is, they’re BOMB. But these delicious rolls are sadly off limits to the gluten-intolerant—until now!</p><p>That’s right. Last week, a gluten-free baked goods company called Canyon Bakehouse <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released Gluten-Free Hawaiian Rolls</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>for our gluten-free enjoyment. Celiacs rejoice!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-exactly-are-hawaiian-rolls-and-will-gluten-free-hawaiian-rolls-live-up-to-the-golden-standard-set-by-their-glutenous-cousins>So, what exactly are Hawaiian rolls? And will Gluten-Free Hawaiian Rolls&nbsp;live up to the golden standard set by their glutenous cousins?&nbsp;</h2><p>When we think of Hawaiian rolls, we think of those pillowy sweet bread rolls in bright orange packaging from Hawaii-based company King’s Hawaiian. These bread rolls are a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">version of Portuguese sweet bread</a>, a fluffy dinner roll (sometimes sweetened with pineapple juice) that was brought to Hawaii by Portuguese immigrants in the 1800s and has been popular on the island ever since.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Canyon Bakehouse</a> released a gluten-free Hawaiian sweet bread back in 2018, and then earlier this year, they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> gluten-free brioche-style rolls. If people liked both those products, which they seemingly did, that bodes well for their newest carbo-creation. While I haven’t tried these new rolls yet, they certainly sound delicious. The company describes them as “slightly sweet with a soft, pillowy texture,” which sounds about right for a Hawaiian sweet roll, so I have high hopes.</p><p>These new Gluten-Free Hawaiian Rolls are now available in grocery stores all across the U.S. In addition to being gluten-free, these puppies are made with whole grains and are also&nbsp;dairy, nuts, sesame, and soy-free, so basically they were&nbsp;made&nbsp;with dietary restrictions in mind. We finally live in a world where being gluten-free doesn’t have to mean Hawaiian roll-free, and that’s a world I am very happy to be living in.&nbsp;Thanks, Canyon Ridge!</p><p>One final question: If I put two of these rolls together, can I call them “glutenous minimus,” because they would look like a tiny butt and contain no gluten?</p><p>Great question, and yes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJ%2BcqsGmuoyfqZ6dXZ2uuK3IopinZaKkua2%2FjKecsKtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
