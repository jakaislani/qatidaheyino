From romantic paranoia to a near-death situation, the NFL has it all. But some are more outspoken about it, while others wrap it deep inside them. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Tom Brady</a> and Damar Hamlin could be the best examples of it. We all know them because of their outstanding performance on the field, but their backstory is enough to put anyone in deep sorrow.</p><p>While both the players went through one of the worst phases of their lives, their way of dealing is inverse to each other. Tom Brady’s divorce has remained under wraps from the world for months. No doubt, his ex-wife did open up about it in a couple of interviews, but Star QB has always been tight-lipped about it. Damar Hamlin never shies away from showing his emotion and gratitude to those who protected him from such a horrific cardiac arrest.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Hamlin’s victory from death:</h2><p><span>Damar Hamlin’s terrible situation is no stranger to anyone. He went through a horrific cardiac arrest during a match with the Cincinnati Bengals, for which he had to undergo CPR. Bill’s training staff came to his aid and provided him with CPR as soon as possible. He was then admitted to the hospital in Cincinnati as he was in a deep coma, but within a few days, he got back to his senses. The doctors in the hospital applaud Bill’s training team, which provides Hamlin with CPR in such a crisis.</span></p><p><span>On the ESPY Awards 2023, Hamlin got a chance to present Pat Tillman Awards for service to his beloved training staff, who were his loyal life-savers. While presenting the award, he couldn’t resist and mourned in front of all. The attendees stood for him and cheered him up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Please welcome this year’s recipient of the Pat Tillman Award for Service, the training staff of Buffalo Bills,” </span><span>Damar said in a teary voice. </span><span>The entire staff hugged him, and Bill thanked him for being alive. Despite such a horrific incident, Hamlin’s recovery is remarkable.</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-nba-nfl-boxing-news-comparing-shaquille-oneal-lebron-james-with-tom-brady-ufc-legend-drops-his-two-cents-on-the-ridiculous-tyson-fury-vs-francis-ngannou-while-picking-the-winner-sure-he-can-be?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Francis-Ngannou-Tyson-fury-560x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Comparing Shaquille O’Neal, Lebron James With Tom Brady, UFC Legend Drops His Two Cents on the “Ridiculous” Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou While Picking the Winner- “Sure He Can Beat Him…”</p></a><p><span>Tom Brady also has one heart-breaking story. But he hardly opened up about it.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Tom Brady’s eye-wrenching love story:</h2><p>After being together for more than a decade, quarterback Tom Brady and supermodel Gisele Bundchen ended their love saga <span>this</span> January. It was indeed shocking for the entire Brady fandom. But <span>intriguingly,</span> Tom Brady never opened up about it or showed distress in front of the world. He presented a happy face, suggesting the GOAT had moved on gracefully. Gisele shared it on Instagram. The world <span>came to know</span> about it only when Gisele <span>penned it down on</span> her Instagram story.</p><p>“With much gratitude for our time together, Tom and I have amicably finalized our divorce. My priority has always been and will continue to be our children, whom I love with all my <span>heart.”</span> Gisele wrote.</p><p>No matter what, we cannot deny that both are one of the finest players in NFL history.
