After all, he has quite the passion for two-wheeled adventures, and vintage motorcycle maintenance doesn’t come cheap.</p><h2 id=h-norman-reedus-net-worth data-injectable=false>Norman Reedus’ net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=845 data-injectable=true>It turns out that breathing life into a fan-favorite brooding crossbow-wielding pariah for 11 seasons (plus spin-offs) of a huge television franchise pays pretty worthwhile dividends. Norman Reedus is worth an estimated $25 million, per the most recent data coming from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. During the peak of The Walking Dead’s popularity, Reedus was reportedly getting paid around $1 million per episode. Give or take a few hundred thousand dollars over 177 episodes (though he didn’t appear in all of them), that’s quite a solid payday.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>The Florida native’s riches don’t start and stop with his turn as Daryl (though of course, his Walking Dead tenure continues in a spin-off centered around his character, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon</a>). There’s also his film and voice acting career, as well as his various modeling gigs for the likes of Prada, Levi’s, and Lexus, among others. AMC and its audience simply can’t get enough of the star roaming on motorcycles, with the network having ordered six seasons of the docuseries Ride with Norman Reedus.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>As recently as 2021, it was also reported that Reedus and his wife Diane Kruger own a home in the Hollywood Hills, for which they paid $8.5 million at the time of purchase. The actor and his family have also owned various properties in and around New York.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZ6kv66tzWapnp2UqsBuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
