As previously reported, Selena and Justin were in an on-and-off relationship for nearly a decade before calling it quits for the final time in the summer of 2018. Coincidentally, around that time, Justin and Hailey, who were also together in the past, rekindled their relationship, got engaged, and would ultimately get married that same year.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Immediately following their nuptials, Hailey revealed that she was allegedly getting bullied online for her union with Justin by Selena‚Äôs fans, which the ‚ÄúWho Says‚Äù vocalist tried to stop for years, though her request was made to no avail, apparently. After some years and an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous peace offering photo,</a> Hailey And Selena‚Äôs feud would be reignited this year when the Rhode CEO allegedly commented on the fat-shaming remarks Selena was receiving from the public by posting a now-deleted TikTok video.</p><p data-characters=620 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>The entire situation came to a head on March 24, when Selena revealed on her Instagram story that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hailey ‚Äúreached out‚Äù to her personally</a> to inform the 30-year-old of the hate she has been getting on her social media platforms, including death threats.&nbsp;In the upload, the&nbsp;Only Murders in the Building&nbsp;star expressed that despite the history between the women, this isn‚Äôt what she ‚Äústands for‚Äù and urged her fans to stop. In addition to the story, Selena followed Hailey on Instagram in an attempt to end the feud once and for all. The 26-year-old followed suit by following Selena back.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>As that news circulated online, many social media users mentioned on Twitter that since the entire debacle between Selena and Hailey reignited, Justin has not defended his wife. Although in the past, Justin has<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> spoken out about the constant bullying</a> Hailey is subjected to from fans, the 29-year-old has stayed relatively silent this year.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>One individual wrote how ironic it is that Hailey had to reach out to Selena to stop the cyberbullying, because Justin didn‚Äôt do anything.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>hailey had to reach out to selena gomez to defend her because her husband didn't‚Ä¶ i can't make this sht up <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LQCnEEGWGd</a></p>‚Äî nisha (@runawaynisha) <a href=#>March 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>At the same time, another Twitter user claimed that this entire situation was ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù because Justin didn‚Äôt stand up for Hailey.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the way justin bieber is staying quiet in all of this is so embarrassing if you think about it like if i had to reach out my husband's ex to stop people from bullying me while my husband conveniently doesn't speak on it id leave him <a href=#>https://t.co/zNgSyQ37Xr</a></p>‚Äî zay (@lenasdaya) <a href=#>March 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>A third person showcased the numerous times Selena has urged her fans to stop bullying Hailey online, and claimed she did ‚Äúmore than‚Äù the model‚Äôs husband.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the fact that selena gomez defended hailey bieber more times than her husband üíÄ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mxXLDcukro</a></p>‚Äî Ÿãlinda (@selsbossanova) <a href=#>March 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>While another social media user suggested that everyone should have an open dialogue about Justin staying silent as his wife received alleged death threats.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>So when are we gonna talk about the fact that Selena Gomez has publicly defended Hailey Bieber more times than Justin Bieber? ü§® <a href=#>https://t.co/zFyCi8pRPv</a></p>‚Äî It's Indictmas!
