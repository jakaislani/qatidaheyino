This crime marked a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement. Three men responsible for Collins' murder were brought to justice between 1977 and 2002.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Addie Mae Collins was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on April 18, 1949. She attended the 16th Street Baptist Church with her parents, Julius and Alice, as well as her six siblings. On the morning of Sunday, September 15, 1963, 14-year-old Collins was in the church basement room with a group of other children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At 10:22 a.m., a bomb exploded under the steps of the church. Collins was killed in the blast along with Denise McNair, 11, and Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, both 14. In addition to the four fatalities, more than 20 people were injured. One of these was Collins' younger sister, Sarah, who lost an eye and sustained other serious injuries.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Political Context</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The bombing that killed Collins and her friends was a racially motivated hate crime. It occurred in the context of social upheaval in the city of Birmingham, which earned the moniker "Bombingham" after a spate of terrorist activities.</p><img alt="Denise McNair, 11; Carole Robertson, 14; Addie Mae Collins, 14; and Cynthia Wesley, 14; from left, are shown in these 1963 photos.

In May 1963, city and civil rights leaders negotiated the integration of public spaces, sparking widespread violence. The 16th Street Church, frequently used as a meeting place for leaders including <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> and Ralph D. Abernathy, was an obvious target for this activity.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Prosecutions</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Collins' murder remained officially unsolved until the 1970s. Robert Chambliss, a member of a Ku Klux Klan group that was seen placing the dynamite under the church steps, was arrested in 1963, but tried only for illegal possession of explosives. The case remained dormant until 1971, when Attorney General William Baxley reopened it. Baxley obtained FBI files containing substantive information, including the names of suspects, which had been withheld by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/j-edgar-hoover data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="J. Edgar Hoover" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">J. Edgar Hoover</a> in the 1960s. In a later statement, the FBI stated that their investigation had been impeded by the lack of witness cooperation in Birmingham.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1977, a 73-year-old Chambliss was convicted of the murder of Collins and sentenced to life in prison. Two other perpetrators—Thomas Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry—were convicted in 2001 and 2002, respectively. A fourth suspect, Herman Frank Cash, died in 1994, before he could be charged.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Legacy and Mystery After Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Collins and her fellow victims became symbols of racial violence, styled as martyrs in the struggle for civil rights. In 2013, the United States Congress awarded each girl the Congressional Gold Medal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Collins family appears in the 1997 Spike Lee film 4 Little Girls, a documentary on the bombing and its political significance. In 1998, the Collins family requested that Addie Mae's body be exhumed and moved to another cemetery. Her body was not in the spot where it was presumed to be. After decades of neglect, the cemetery records were found to be incomplete and the location of the body had been lost.</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Addie Mae Collins</li><li>Birth Year: 1949</li><li>Birth date: April 18, 1949</li><li>Birth State: Alabama</li><li>Birth City: Birmingham</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Addie Mae Collins was a 14-year-old murder victim whose 1963 death focused public attention on racial violence in the South.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Christianity</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Aries</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Three men were convicted of murdering Addie Mae Collins long after her death, in trials held between 1977 and 2002.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1963</li><li>Death date: September 15, 1963</li><li>Death State: Alabama</li><li>Death City: Birmingham</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=28><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Addie Mae Collins Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/crime/addie-mae-collins</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: September 4, 2019</li><li>Original Published Date: April 3, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6GdmnyisMOinGalkZp6pLvLpaCnqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
