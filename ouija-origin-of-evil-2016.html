But more importantly, the session he, Lina and her friends have inspires Lina to tell Alice to incorporate the board into her psychic act. Alice buys one, and we learn the three rules that you know will be violated: Don’t play alone, don’t play in a graveyard, and always say goodbye to whatever the hell it is you were talking to on the board. Nobody says goodbye, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be leaving.</p><p>Of course, Doris plays alone, because this movie needs a scary little girl. Unlike her successors from the first movie, however, she waits for the board to complete its answers. The Zanders are a bit too calm when the Ouija board’s planchette starts moving by itself, and Doris starts to have a real connection to the spirit world. But there’s an explanation for that—Alice’s mother had real psychic powers. “Maybe it skips a generation,” she says before incorporating Doris into her now-realistic readings. Unfortunately, Alice doesn’t know the real reason her daughter has become a wi-fi hotspot for the deceased: She’s possessed by a really creepy-looking entity.</p><p>If we’ve got possession, we gotta have a priest. He’s Doris’ school principal Father Tom, a man of the cloth who found the seminary after his wife passed away. This potential exorcist is played by <a href=#>Henry Thomas</a>, who once starred in a movie that also bore the grungy, old Universal logo, “E.T.” Thomas is very good here, especially in a scene where he and Alice go on what would normally be described as a date. The two actors let their attraction for one another play out without once acting upon it. These two, lonely widowed people walk that tightrope knowing the safety net of Father Tom’s priesthood hangs comfortably below them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46orKKikWK8s7XGoqVmp5Zisre1y2ZpaWlm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
