Now, almost five months later, the Wednesday star has finally pulled up to a style shindig — and at <a href=# class=T3D>Paris Fashion Week</a>, no less.</p><p>Though time may have passed, Ortega is still, thankfully, squarely in her<strong> </strong>Addams Family era — and she proved this on Tuesday while attending Christian Dior’s Spring 2024 show.</p><h2>Jenna Ortega’s Nevermore Academy-Inspired Co-ords</h2><p>As Dior’s ambassador, the actor sat front-row, decked out in the brand from head to toe. Her vibes were decidedly gothic, in an almost-black navy blazer (with that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>signature Dior cinched waist</a>) and a matching pleated midi skirt that fell just above her ankles. The skirt suit was undeniably reminiscent of the Nevermore Academy uniforms, only much, much chicer.</p><p>It’s hardly the first time Ortega channeled her murder mystery-solving on-screen alter-ego.<strong> </strong>After Netflix’s Wednesday soared to the top of streaming charts last November, fans noticed that <a href=# class=T3D>Ortega’s style DNA</a> has always been eerily similar to that of her kooky character.</p><p>In the last year, however, the similarities have become even more apparent. Ortega has been leaning heavily into her goth girl sensibilities, often cloaking herself in punk-y all-black ensembles and school girl-style suits<strong> </strong>à la Nevermore. Her Dior ensemble hit on all the Wednesday elements.</p><p>Ortega paired the set with footwear that gave her ‘fit a gothic twist: black lace-up boots. Between the angular toe and thick black laces, the chunky shoe gave off clear steampunk vibes.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><h2>She Added An NSFW Twist</h2><p>Veering from academia-inspired dress codes, Ortega took the look to NSFW (or, in Wednesday’s case, Not Safe For School) levels. She wore a gauzy<strong> </strong>black top that was utterly see-through under her unbuttoned blazer, intentionally revealing the black bra beneath.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>WWD/WWD/Getty Images</p></figure><p>As for the rest of her getup, Ortega expertly switched gears with accessories that added a touch of glamour to her look. Layered one atop the other, a smattering of earrings, rings, and long necklaces — all pieces from the French label’s <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Rose Des Vents collection</a> —<strong> </strong>sent the outfit into luxe territory.</p><p>Ortega starred in the collection’s campaign mere weeks ago, so it’s fitting that she’d choose adornments from the line for her PFW outing.<strong></strong></p><h2>& Finished With A Dior Makeup Bag</h2><p>Ortega topped off her look with a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>$2,750 Dior bag</a> blanketed in the famous monogram. The choice was masterfully playful, as the luxe accessory actually isn’t a handbag at all, but a vanity case. Ortega merely removed the shoulder strap to turn it into an elegant top-handle bag, one of <a href=# class=T3D>the year’s trendiest styles</a>.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Marc Piasecki/WireImage/Getty Images</p></figure><h2>Her Makeup Was Bronze & Glowy</h2><p>As for her glam, Ortega opted for a bronzed look which included peach blush, a subtle smoky eye, and neutral lipstick. Meanwhile, she swept her hair into an updo and let her trendy “<a href=# class=T3D>shadow bangs</a>” frame her face.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Marc Piasecki/WireImage/Getty Images</p></figure><p>A fashion girl if I ever saw one.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on Sep. 27, 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07KjnmeamruvrYyoqa2dl5Z6o77AZpuip6JivaK%2ByKxkn5mjnbawuoywnJ6jXaiyscDEppmeql1nfXN%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
