The pair worked together on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>; Williams played an Echo Base Trooper in the film, and the photo shared by Hamill shows both of them on the set of the film ‚Äî presumably around 1980.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just heard the awful news that the world has lost <a href=#>@Rtreatwilliams</a>. Such a wonderful person‚Ä¶ such a gifted actor‚Ä¶ such a treasured friend. I'm gutted. <a href=#>#RIP_Pal</a> üíî <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YZ7x3M4dF7</a></p>‚Äî Mark Hamill (@MarkHamill) <a href=#>June 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=892 data-injectable=true>Williams had a very long and successful career spanning nearly 50 years with his most notable role being in Hair (1979), which he received a Golden Globe nomination for. Although, he and Hamill were rarely seen working on the same shows or movies. Aside from The Empire Strikes Back, the only other project in which they may have crossed paths professionally might have been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman: The Animated </a><a href=#>Series</a>. Williams voiced professor Achilles Milo for two episodes, and Hamill, as we all know, is the voice of the Joker. However, their characters weren‚Äôt even in the same episode, so who knows?</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=false>It seems more likely that the two were just good friends outside of work. Hamill‚Äôs tribute is not the only one, as other Hollywood icons have taken the time to write kind words, including Malcolm McDowell, James Woods, and Billy Baldwin ‚Äî <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">among others.</a> Fans also expressed their shock at the actor‚Äôs passing underneath Hamill‚Äôs heartfelt tweet. While Treat Williams may be gone, his legacy among his friends in Hollywood clearly lives on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S6or7KZp%2BapZmhuW68wLKqZqyinq%2B2wMRmq6hlmJ7AbrLRopynnF2pv6at02auoqScnq6uv4yipWaglZa%2Fta7RnpikoZ6cerXDxJ6raA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
