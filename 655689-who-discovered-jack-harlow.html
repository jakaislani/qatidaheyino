Surprisingly, this song led to him gradually building a small fanbase and providing him with money to buy a professional mic. He then released his first solo debut mixtape, Extra Credit, Mr. Harlow.&nbsp;As his prominence began to rise, many big names in the industry started noticing him. According to Louisville Magazine, Harlow's parents started getting calls from companies wanting to manage him when he was 14. Scooter Braun, who manages <a href=# class=text-word rel>Justin Bieber</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ariana Grande</a>, is one of the persons that reached out to him. Later on, Braun flew Jack Harlow to his home in Los Angeles so they could meet him. Harlow told the magazine, " biggest house I've ever been in." However, things did not turn out well with Scooter Braun.</p><p>In 2017, he told Louisville Magazine that the money he made from streaming services and live shows wasn't enough for him. Eventually, he got a job in the cafeteria at Georgia State University so he could pay his bills. On MTV's Total Request Live, Harlow said that he only worked there for about a month before meeting DJ Drama. Fortunately, he signed him to his subsidiary label Generation Now, which is part of Atlantic Records.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jack-harlow-career-life>Jack Harlow: Career Life</h2></span><p>Now that he was signed to a major label, Harlow talked about two crucial goals for his future. "I want to make a living," he told XXL. "I want to take care of my family and friends and all that good stuff." Harlow added, "Secondly, I just want to make the culture better. Do or see things no one else has done or seen."</p><p>After releasing two well-received mixtapes and earning a BET Award, the Louisville rapper astonishingly released "Whats Poppin." Fortunately, the song went viral on YouTube and TikTok in January 2020 before making it to radio and streaming services. Furthermore, "Whats Poppin" peaked at No. 2 on Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and was later nominated for a Grammy. Also, in 2020, Jack released his debut album, That's What They All Say.</p><p>Harlow put out several singles in 2021, including "Industry Baby" with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Nas X</a>. In a blink of an eye, he got his second Grammy nomination for his part in "Industry Baby." Additionally, he also worked with Pooh Shiesty on "SUVs." His second full-length album, <a href=# rel>Come Home The Kids Miss You</a>, came out in May 2022.&nbsp; Harlow has been featured in GQ, Spin, and Complex. Also, he was named Variety's Hitmaker of the Year and one of Forbes' 30 Under 30 music stars last year.
