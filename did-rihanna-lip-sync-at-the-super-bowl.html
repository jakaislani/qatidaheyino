After a ton of speculation from viewers (and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some disappointment in the lack of guest appearances)</a>, the singer confirmed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she‚Äôs pregnant with her second child</a> less than a year after she and boyfriend A$AP Rocky welcomed the birth of their first son.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Many noticed Rihanna seemed less energetic than normal and stans were quick to criticize her 13-minute performance. Some of her critics backed off when the singer‚Äôs team confirmed she was expecting, but still some were not satisfied with Rihanna‚Äôs halftime performance. The popstar <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confessed it was difficult to settle on a setlist</a> that would make fans happy but the main complaint viewers had was not about her song choices but whether she was singing at all.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>The Super Bowl halftime show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has a long history</a>, and shows have only become more elaborate as the years go by. Performers are expected to put on a concert of their greatest hits and viewers long for spectacle. Rihanna‚Äôs halftime extravaganza was no different and featured a complex stage setup, backup dancers, and a 12-song setlist. Was lip syncing part of why her show felt off to some fans?</p><h2 id=h-did-rihanna-lip-sync-her-halftime-show-performance data-injectable=false>Did Rihanna lip sync her halftime show performance?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>rihanna ATE and left no crumbs<br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4VlbgToF0i</a></p>‚Äî üáÆüá≥üçí (@memealuvzCLx) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=664 data-current-count=964 data-injectable=true>We‚Äôre unlikely to get confirmation either way, but the Super Bowl has famously had incidents where performers mimed their halftime performances in the past. During the 2014 Super Bowl, Red Hot Chili Peppers‚Äô bassist Flea came under fire when viewers realized <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his bass guitar was not plugged in to an amplifier</a>, making it obvious there was no way he could be heard over the roar of the crowd. A couple days after the show, Flea wrote a post on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the band‚Äôs website</a>, confirming he did not play live. In his post, Flea wrote that while singer Anthony Kiedis did sing live, the other members of the band were told to pre-record their parts in advance.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>There are a lot of reasons why Super Bowl performers would choose to pre-record aspects of their performances. Halftime show stars are under a lot of pressure to perform a technically perfect concert while moving on potentially unstable platforms. All this is done before the eyes of millions who expect it all to appear effortless. Singing live over their own vocal track can give singers a sense of security in case of potential mistakes (which are sure to be viewed on Twitter hundreds of times after the fact).</p><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=false>There are some signs you can look out for when determining whether someone‚Äôs lip syncing. Even the best live vocals won‚Äôt sound too perfect, and a live recording will still have breathing, voice cracks, and the sound of clothes ruffling left in. For many streamed performances, it can be hard to tell if a singer is truly singing live as many shows will have sound engineers prepared to auto-tune and remove any unwanted sounds from even a live performance. Unless she tells us herself, we can‚Äôt know if Rihanna lip synced, but can you really blame her if she did?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46doJ1lop61orrNmmSloaBiwLq6wmaYrWWknbJuv9SpnKtlkqTErXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
