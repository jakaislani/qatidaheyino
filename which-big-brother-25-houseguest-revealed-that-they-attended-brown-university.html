I plan to stay low at the beginning, just because that strategy has worked for past players, but I’m definitely just going to be the sweet, bubbly, charismatic person, and get to know everybody and be genuine with them (and then lie to whoever I need to… I don’t mind). I’m going to do whatever it takes to win the game. I have an Ivy League degree, so I’ll definitely be keeping that from my fellow houseguests. I just don’t want to come off as the smarty pants and be automatically targeted because of it, so I’m going to keep that a secret.”</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false>It looks like love may have clouded her judgement!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-design-44-1.png><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>With some extra internet sleuthing, we discovered that America was not only at Brown University as a student, but also as an athlete.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Based on the profile <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brown University Cheerleading Team</a> on Facebook, it looks like America was a member of the cheerleading team prior to graduating back in 2018 – is there anything that she can’t do?</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>Now that her secret is out to Cory (as well as Big Brother viewers across the country), one very popular fan theory is getting even more traction: America Lopez might not be who she says she is.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@jjruls</a> on Reddit explained the theory best in a post last month:</p><p>“Hear me out, what spooks me about America Lopez is how she doesn’t have any social media. She’s a 27-year-old girl from Texas, how does she not have at least an old Facebook account or something? People have looked and have yet to find it. Knowing that, it got me thinking, maybe America Lopez is using a fake identity as part of the multiverse twist… I think part of that twist is that at some point in the season, America Lopez will revert to her true identity, which is the current universe. America Lopez was an alternate identity who worked a different job, lived in a different place, and had a different name, so the whole game America Lopez has been lying and now is starting the game as a brand new person. Will people not trust her since she’s been lying all summer? They could also have her just play out the game, and if she gets evicted then she can come back as her true identity, or if she goes all the way to the end it is revealed after the votes. I think the reveal could be an iconic moment.”</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Given that she has been hiding her past with her fellow houseguests, what else could America be hiding during her time on Big Brother?</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>Is her name really America? Is she actually 27 years old? Is she even from Texas?
