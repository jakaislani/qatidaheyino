First Pop Tart lovers began to notice a tell-tale gap on the shelves as the flavor sold out at store after store. Then they noticed that, alas, that gap was not being refilled. The gap in question is where Frosted Cinnamon Roll Pop Tarts were known to reside. Here for a short while, then gone in the blink of an eye, never to return again, just like a lightning strike, a news cycle on Instagram, and my early twenties (seriously, did they even happen? I swear I missed them). But if you are one of the many people who once swore by this Pop Tart flavor only to have the proverbial Frosted Cinnamon Roll Pop Tart-shaped rug pulled out from under you last summer, don’t fret because your flavor is BACK, baybee! Well, sort of.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-are-frosted-cinnamon-roll-pop-tarts-back-or-not-stop-toying-with-our-emotions-and-just-tell-us-the-tea-jessica-this-is-not-a-drill>So…are Frosted Cinnamon Roll Pop Tarts back or not? Stop toying with our emotions and just tell us the tea, Jessica. This is not a drill.</h2><p>Okayokayokay, I hear you. So here’s the sitch (as internationally renowned superspy Kimberly Possible would say): Frosted Cinnamon Roll Pop Tarts, which had a good, long run <a href=# rel=noopener>from 2015 to 2023</a>, are not coming back, at least as of right now. However, for a limited time, the brand has brought back the Frosted Cinnamon Roll flavor in the form of Frosted Cinnamon Roll Pop Tart Bites. They’ve just started hitting stores in the last week or so, and according to the Pop Tarts team, they will have the exact same flavor as the previously discontinued full-sized tarts, they’ll just be mini and also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">come in little packets.</a> &nbsp;So we have no reason to believe these will taste any different from the original Pop Tart version—my only hangup is the whole surface area-to-volume ratio thing. Technically, a smaller tart would mean more crust compared to icing and filling, but it’s possible the good people who design Pop Tarts thought of that and adjusted everything accordingly, so I am not knockin’ them tills I tries them.</p><p>And we can all try them now (for however long “limited” means) for just $3.99 per five-pack at stores nationwide. And hey, having your favorite flavor discontinued really bites…but if the bites are good, then maybe not having the big size around is not so bad. Plus, if these bites go over well enough, maybe they will bring back the regular-sized version and order shall once again be restored to the breakfast aisle. Only time will tell. But until then, all we can do is give these new bites a try and determine if they are indeed as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CRAAAZY GOOD</a> as the preposterously peppy Pop Tart people would have us believe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJ6ipMC1scNmmqKmnpa6sLqMq6alpF2lvLF505qpratdl7a1sdJmpZ6vo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
