This propels&nbsp;lead baddie Kassen (<a href=#>Garret Dillahunt</a>, whose riff on malevolence is to smoke cigarettes inside a diner and generally seem weary of this shit) and his men to to the&nbsp;cabin to get the drugs themselves. The stakes are obvious from the beginning to Joe&nbsp;that his family&nbsp;will not survive after giving the drugs back, so the second half of&nbsp;“Braven” turns into a bloated fight scene with more dead bodies than pings of simple&nbsp;amusement you might feel owed&nbsp;from the premise alone.&nbsp;</p><p>With such a simple concept, and with its big showdown happening only over the course of a couple hours or so, there’s a disappointing lack of tightness to the big picture. Instead of sharpening its basic elements like character and location, "Braven" piles on more stuff; the script even works overtime to set things up at the cabin and with the dumb truckers, as if we’re to be emotionally invested in their oopsie-daisy, until it starts to directly affect the Bravens. Later on, the script&nbsp;adds crossbow-toting Stephanie&nbsp;and some cops, creating more opportunities for people to battle&nbsp;but less chance of immediacy. As “Braven” becomes more than just&nbsp;than an impromptu OK Corral showdown, there are still too many moving pieces to worry about any one&nbsp;of them in particular.&nbsp;</p><p>Oeding, himself formerly a stunt coordinator, makes a case that he could be a strong fight scene director in due time, but his directorial comprehension lacks a&nbsp;sense of space and the people within it. While Momoa's character is&nbsp;more compelling than just watching a modern, housebroken Khal Drogo,&nbsp;the forces of evil he's up against (gun-toting henchmen with beards)&nbsp;aren’t so much forgettable as inconsequential. And the free-for-all setting of the snowy woods, for all of its opportunities of visibility and camouflage, is wasted by not establishing a concrete sense of the property's geography (even though the opening credits are dedicated to setting Newfoundland's amazing views).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bqZqulaN6c3yQcQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
