Despite being in the public eye, the comedian is notoriously tight-lipped about his relationships and marriage.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Some people consider Tosh to be eccentric, and he found someone who resonates with his choice to keep the personal matters behind the curtains.&nbsp;His wife, Carley Hallam, seems to be a private person herself.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p><span><span><span>Lauded for his black comedy, Tosh is immensely good at his craft.&nbsp;But there have been times when he has found himself in hot waters due to his comic style.</span></span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span><span>His comedy show&nbsp;</span>Tosh. O&nbsp;premiered way back in 2009 and is&nbsp;a big hit owing to self-deprecating and dark humor.</span></span></p><p><span><span>R</span></span><span><span>eacting to the controversies surrounding him, the television host once clarified&nbsp;he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not&nbsp;</a><span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">misogynistic and racist</a> — he just found such jokes hilarious.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>An audience member of his&nbsp;</span>Laughter Factory&nbsp;show once alleged he made some improper remarks about sexual assault during his performance. Soon after, Tosh took to Twitter and issued a public apology in a now-deleted post.&nbsp;</span></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span><span>The creator of HBO’s</span>&nbsp;Girls&nbsp;and actress Lena Dunham was also not amused when Tosh&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>reportedly commented on</span></a>&nbsp;her breasts,&nbsp;expressing her unhappiness in a public forum.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span>Tosh’s Wife And His Other Relationships&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span><span>Tosh dated&nbsp;model Megan Abrig&nbsp;for many years before calling it quits.&nbsp;He exchanged vows with Carly Hallam, his now-wife. The duo got married in a private ceremony in 2016 but kept the news of their marriage a&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">closely guarded secret</a>.</span></span></p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Hallam is an actress and a writer by profession and&nbsp;is 12 years junior to him.

The duo has been also tight-lipped about whether they plan to have kids or not.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span><span><span>Tosh has been a strong advocate for legalizing gay marriage.
