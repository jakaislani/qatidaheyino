She is present with every pulse of her being as Magda, a young mother in Madrid who learns in the first scene that she must undergo chemo, followed by a mastectomy. She initially frets more about the pending loss of her right nipple (an ongoing theme) and having to reschedule her hair appointment than she does the status of her health.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the other less-than-uplifting circumstances of her life—defined by an absent philandering philosophy professor husband, a soccer-mad son who craves a father figure and her status as an unemployed teacher—slosh around her like a tub brimming with soap-operatic suds.</p><p>Not that writer/director <a href=#>Julio Medem</a> (playing it safer than he did with his 2001 sensation “Sex and Lucia”) avoids pulling out all the indie visual stops to heighten the experience of seeing Magda's inner transformation as the disease alters her viewpoint and the choices she makes. “Ma Ma” opens with what turns into a recurring image of an icy pane of glass that reveals a pale, sad-faced girl walking through a blizzard. With its spacious balcony,&nbsp;Magda’s well-appointed apartment is almost Nancy Meyers-level in its décor, while subdued piano music plays in the background. And when she feels the woozy effects of her ordeals, the camera goes back and forth like a wave-battered dinghy. We also get to occasionally peer at her heart as its beat shifts according to what she is undergoing, with frequent jump-cuts keeping us on guard.</p><p>But for all of these artistic touches as a director, Medem the screenwriter disappointingly provides zero female support in the form of relatives or friends for Magda, save for a kindly nurse. Instead, her handsome married gynecologist Julián (<a href=#>Asier Etxeandia</a>) seems to have endless time to devote to Magda’s well-being, including serenading her now and then with cheesy love ballads. She also runs into a kindly soccer scout named Arturo (<a href=#>Luis Tosar</a>) at her son’s match, just as Arturo receives the tragic news that his daughter has died in a car crash and his wife is in a coma. How convenient that they can rely on each other to fill their emotional gaps as Magda’s husband gallivants about all summer with a beautiful student.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mmGalkWJ%2FcX2V</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
