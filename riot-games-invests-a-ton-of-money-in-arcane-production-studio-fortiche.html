This investment allows Riot to hold a non-controlling stake in Fortiche, while also helping their efforts forward with the company’s staggering $20+ billion pool of resources.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>Fortiche’s co-founders released a statement today regarding this investment deal, which reads as follows:</p><p>“The various collaborations with Riot Games, and especially&nbsp;Arcane, have made Fortiche Production a new major player on the international animation scene. Riot Games, by trusting us, has given us the means to achieve our common ambitions and has shown that it is possible to offer new content that can reach a large audience. In 2023, we will celebrate 10 years of collaboration: there is no better way to symbolize the trust and ambitions of our two companies than this association!”</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>This can hopefully allow Fortiche to speed up the development of the highly-anticipated next chapter in the story of Vi and Jinx in Arcane. Because as successful and acclaimed as the animated adaptation turned out to be, I don’t suppose that most fans would care much about waiting another six years for Fortiche and Riot to prepare the forthcoming 9-hour run, since it took them that long to finish work on season one.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>In all fairness, though, conceiving a project takes much more effort than continuing down an established line. That’s particularly true of animation, where every tiny asset in the world takes a lot of imagining and labor to bring to life, especially for Arcane which boasts a unique and novel animation style.</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=false>As fans of this fictional world, we can’t wait to see what Riot and Fortiche will have in store for fans next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yztc6tZKCZnZrAbrXNr5ysrKNirm7AzqdkqJ5doryvsdhmoKdlkaeworrEZqerp5SqsLW1zqdkrKylmbawecWoqa2hk52ycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
