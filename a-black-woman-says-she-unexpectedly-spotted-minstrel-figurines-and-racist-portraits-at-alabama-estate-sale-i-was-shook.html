She explained that once she got to the crowded location, she realized that the shoes were not her size, but she continued to browse the home for other finds.</p><p>“That’s when I started seeing everything,” she said, adding, “I just froze. I was shook. These people were ransacking the house for this stuff.”</p><p>Synclaire noted that she had previously attended sales from the event host and had never come across racist items in the past. She said she wished she had gotten a heads-up that it wasn’t a “safe place.” However, she did purchase a Coach bag, a vintage denim tote bag, two crossbody bags, two belts and a pair of Uggs for $12.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you ask me, it should have been free for the amount of trauma that I went through,” Synclaire added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49xZmlqX5Z6o7jAnKJmr5%2Birq950pqwrGWjnbJuwc2er6mdk6mypbjYZqqpp6SpsqV5zKKlrKyimrlussigrKuhnprAbq3NnWSrmZOewLV5z6ipraqRnsG0ecCtZJqkkZeurq2MnqqtmaSaerSty55komWnlsBuv8eopqRn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
