In 1985, he starred as Pap Finn in the musical Big River and stayed until he was cast in his first sizable film role: the David Byrne comedy True Stories. This led to a role in Raising Arizona. In 1987, he was recruited for the sitcom Roseanne, which won him several Emmy nominations. He has continued his on-screen career by appearing in films such as Monsters, Inc. (2001), Argo (2012) and The Monuments Men (2014).</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John Stephen Goodman was born on June 20, 1952, in Affton, Missouri, to postal worker Leslie Goodman and waitress Virginia Goodman. When Goodman was only 2 years old, his father died of a heart attack, leaving Virginia to raise Goodman and his siblings on her own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goodman went to Affton High School, where he excelled in football and dabbled in theater. Following high school graduation in 1970, he won a football scholarship to Southwest Missouri State University. During his first year, he spent much of his time partying and playing football, but an injury squashed his dreams of a professional sports career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the injury, Goodman changed his major to drama and studied theater with notable actors such as Kathleen Turner and Tess Harper. In 1975, Goodman graduated with his theater degree and headed to New York to become a professional actor. With a loan from his brother, he found an apartment near the theater district in Manhattan. He worked as a bartender and waiter, while he took small jobs in commercials and voice over performances. In 1978, he joined fellow young and struggling actors <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/dennis-quaid data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dennis Quaid" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dennis Quaid</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/bruce-willis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bruce Willis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bruce Willis</a> and Kevin Kline in the Broadway production of Loose Ends, but the play failed to grab audiences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goodman's career began to build serious career momentum in the early 1980s, however, when he landed a string of television and film appearances including a role on Eddie Macon's Run (1982) and Face of Rage (1983). In 1985, he starred as Pap Finn in the Tony-winning Broadway musical Big River and stayed with the production until he was cast in his first big film role: the David Byrne comedy True Stories (1986). This led to a role in another quirky Southwestern feature, the Coen Brothers' cult-smash Raising Arizona (1987), in which Goodman starred with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/nicolas-cage data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nicolas Cage" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nicolas Cage</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Roseanne' and Other Roles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goodman was acting in a 1987 stage production of Antony and Cleopatra in Los Angeles, when an ABC talent scout spotted him and recruited him for a role on a new television sitcom.

Goodman was chosen to play the jovial, tough-loving father and the foil to Barr's sarcastic, sharp-witted mother. The comedy was an overnight hit and became a career-making move for Goodman. He was nominated for an Emmy seven times between 1989 and 1995, and earned a Best Actor Golden Globe Award in 1993.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Goodman also continued performing on the big screen, taking a co-starring role in the successful <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/steven-spielberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steven Spielberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steven Spielberg</a> thriller Arachnophobia (1990), the comedy King Ralph (1991) and the Coen brothers' Barton Fink (1991).
